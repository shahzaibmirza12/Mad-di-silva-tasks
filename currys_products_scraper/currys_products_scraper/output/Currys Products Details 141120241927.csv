SAMSUNG Series 5 Dual Cook Flex NV7B5755SAS/U4 Electric Pyrolytic Smart Oven - Stainless Steel,"Creating two cooking zones in a single oven sounds a bit like wizardry. But it's easy with this Samsung Dual Cook Flex oven. Bake cookies while you roast a chicken – it won't transfer smells. Dual fans help to waft warm air right through the oven, so everything cooks evenly. The hinged Flexible Door means you can access the whole oven, or just the top half.  If you just open the top, you won't lose any heat from the bottom half. And when you're done, just set the pyrolytic cleaning program. It uses really high temperatures to reduce dirt to ash, so you can just wipe it away after. If you're cooking a smaller meal and don't need the whole oven, Dual Cook lets you save over 25% on energy - and as an added bonus, it pre-heats 52% faster when you're only using the top half.Good to know- Cook healthier crispy food using Air Fry – it uses hot air rather than deep frying- SmartThings connectivity means you can get recipe suggestions, guided cooking or even create a weekly meal plan- The A+ rating and fast preheating means you'll save energy and it won't cost the earth to run- The Food Probe makes it easy to make sure you food is cooked all the way throughELECTRICAL INSTALLATION: This product requires professional installation to a dedicated circuit by a qualified installer, such as one of our Tech Experts. Our expert installers may be able to install to a dedicated cooker circuit (identified by a big red cooker switch) if you do not have a 16 Amp supply in your home.25.3% energy savings based on internal testing on Series 5 NV7B5675LAK, upper vs. whole compartment for small cake baking at convection 165°C  (IEC-60350)Internal testing on Series 5 NV7B5675LAK, upper vs. whole compartment for small cake baking at convection 165°C  (IEC-60350)",10239686,ovens-built-in-cooking-appliances,SAMSUNG,1159,In Stock,GBP,"https://media.currys.biz/i/currysprod/10239686

LOGITECH MX Keys Mini Wireless Keyboard - Pale Grey,"Small but mighty  The Logitech MX Keys Mini Wireless Keyboard takes the amazing design of the MX Keys Keyboard and shrinks it to fit in smaller setups. Designed for creatives and engineered for coders, the MX Keys Mini has been crafted for support, stability, and precision.  The quiet and fluid but fast and accurate keystrokes deliver a distinct tactile response. You'll feel the response as you type rather than hear it.  Adjustable backlighting  The backlit keys use a proximity sensor to detect when you're about to type and fade when you leave your desk. Backlighting intensity automatically adapts to the room or can be set manually.  Logitech Flow  Working with your MX Master 3 or other Logitech Flow-enabled mouse, you can move from one device to another without re-connecting. Transfer files, documents, and images across computers and systems with ease.  Experience 10 days of battery life with backlighting or up to 5 months charge with the backlighting off. And when you're low on power, USB Type-C charging will have you up and running in no time.",10230435,keyboard-computer-accessories-computing,LOGITECH,110,In Stock,GBP,"https://media.currys.biz/i/currysprod/10230435

LIAN-LI Lancool III RGB Mid-Tower E-ATX PC Case - Black,"Go all-out on your next build with the modular design and thermals on this Lancool III. There's loads of room inside and incredible adjustability, so you can optimise it for any configuration of air, AIO or water cooling. You can push the boat out to 10 fans or a massive 420 mm radiator. To get you up and running, this comes with four 140 mm fans. You can really get expressive because 3 of them are RGB and there are light mode buttons on the I/O. To admire the lighting and all your fancy components, there are tempered glass panels. If a PC build seems a bit daunting, don't worry. With tons of thoughtful features like slide-through PSU installation, building this up or modifying it is that bit easier for newbies.Good to know- The radiator bracket gives you 4 different ways to mount a radiator or fans and has an easy-to-use latch mechanism- A removable top fan bracket lets you fit beefier fan and radiator combos without intruding on your RAM- You guessed it - the PSU shroud bracket also has incredible adjustability and extra mounting points- Future upgrades are a go because there's room for massive hard drive stacks and clearance for long PSUs- Adding or removing bits and bobs is easy because of the hinged cover doors and handles on the removable tempered glass panels- There are breathable mesh panels, as well as extra space in the chassis to allow for airflow- Because of the sliding cable routing cover, this will work for ATX motherboards all the way up to mega E-ATX ones- Depending on where you put the PC, you can reverse the I/O for better access to your ports- You can add extra kit like dust filter panels and a vertical GPU kit (both sold separately) if your build needs it",10247488,tower-cases-components-upgrades-computing,LIAN-LI,159,In Stock,GBP,"https://media.currys.biz/i/currysprod/10247488
